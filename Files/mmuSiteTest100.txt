Manchester
Met
has
given
me
the
opportunity
to
study
the
areas
that
I
am
passionate
about,
while
being
able
to
live
in
one
of
the
busiest,
most
vibrant
cities
in
the
country;
enrolling
here
is
one
of
the
best
decisions
I
have
ever
made.

There

there
is
something
that
appeals

Choosing
your
degree
is
just
the
beginning.
You
may
not
know
what
career
you
want
to
go
into
but
that
doesn’t
matter
because
you
will
be
introduced
to
so
many
new
and
interesting
topics
that
will
help
you
find
your
way.

What
I
like
most
about
my
course
is
that
it
really
has
opened
my
eyes
to
the
world
around
me;
I
look
at
things
so
differently
now.
This
dynamic
world
we
live
in
is
constantly
changing
and
I
love
how
my
degree
keeps
up
with
this.

I
got
the
chance
to
visit
a
different
country,
partake
in
a
different
culture
and
work
with
some
highly
talented
young
individuals
who
I
see
as
the
future
of
journalism.

Future events
At
the
present
time,
we
are
still
planning
to
host
open
day
events
on
campus
in
October
and
November
2020.
These
are
planned
to
take
place
on
Saturday
10 October,
Saturday
17 October,
and
Saturday 28 November 2020.
You
will
be
able
to
book
onto one
of
our
autumn
events
from
the end
of June.
What
to
expect
at
an
open
day
At
an
open
day,
you
can
visit
our
campus,
library,
Students'
Union
and
other
facilities.
You'll
learn
more
about
studying
at
university,
meet
current
students,
visit
our
accommodation
and
get
to
know
Manchester.
Open
days
are
well
worth
coming
to.
They
give
you
a
real
insight
into
the
University
as
a
whole
and
the
resources
that’ll
be
there
for
you
if
you
apply.
My
top
tip
would
be
to
see
which
talks
you
want
to
attend
for
specific
subjects
and
build
your
day
around
that.
Or
see
if
you
can
talk
to
a
student
or
lecturer
at
one
of
the
subject
stands.

Your
guide
to
understanding
what
university
will
look
like
for
your
child.
Your
guide
to
university
We
know
that
as
a
parent
or
guardian
of
someone
considering
university,
you
may
have
many
questions.
From
researching
universities
through
to
enrolment,
the
university
application
process
is
a
busy
and
exciting time.
Understanding
how
the
process
works
can
support
your
child
in
making
a
successful
application.
You
can
also
help
them
make
the
right
decision
by
encouraging
them
to
thoroughly
research
their
course,
where
they
want
to
study
and
what
they
plan
on
doing
after studying.
Familiarise
yourself
with
their
choice
of
course,
university
location
and
accommodation.
This
way
you
can
chat
to
them
about
the
options.

Familiarise
yourself
with
their

accommodation.
This
way

can

to

about
the
options.
Stewart
Cowley
Parent
Is
university
the
right
choice
for
my child?
There
are
many
reasons
why
someone might
consider
university,
from
career
development
to
passion
for
their
subject area.
In
addition
to
academic
qualifications,
higher
education
provides
students
with
independence,
confidence,
and
skills
that
transfer
into
the
world
of
work.
University gives
you the
chance
to
meet
people
from
different
cultures
and
backgrounds,
and
undergo
a
huge
life experience.
Is
it
worth
the cost?
Figures
from
the
Department
of
Education show
that
working-age
graduates
earn
£10,000
more
on
average
than
non-graduates.
They
also
have
a
higher
employment rate.
When
it
comes
to
financing
a
degree,
all
full-time
students
are
entitled
to
a
tuition
fee
loan
to
cover
the
full
cost
of
their
study.
Students
can
also
apply
for
maintenance
loans
to
cover
living
costs.
Repayments
for
these
loans
are
directly
linked
to
how
much
you
earn
after university.
You only
start
to
repay
your
student
loans
when
you
are
earning
at
least
£25,725
per year.
Outstanding
loan
repayments
don’t
count
against
your
credit
rating,
and won’t
affect
things
like
buying
a
car
or
applying
for
a
mortgage.
If
you
earn
below
the
minimum
threshold,
you won’t
repay anything.
Why
study
at
Manchester Metropolitan?
At
Manchester
Met,
your
child
will
join
a
thriving
student
population
of
over
34,000
in
one
of
the
best
student
cities
in
the
world (QS
best
student
cities).
They’ll
get
the
chance
to
choose
from
hundreds
of undergraduate
courses
and
study
in
an
academic
environment
that
we’re
committed
to
constantly improving.
We
help
prepare
our
graduates
for
life
after
university,
and
provide
lifelong careers
support to
our alumni.

right
course
There
are
a
number
of
things
that
might
influence
your
child’s
choice
of
course
and
university.
It
might
seem
difficult
to
know
where
to
start,
but
here
are
a
few
key
things
to consider:
Choice
of course
What
subject
is
your
child
interested
in?
Are
they
interested
in
studying
one
subject
area,
or
do
they
want
to
study
two
subjects
together
in
a
joint
honours
degree?
What
would
they
like
to
do
with
their
degree
after
studying?
It’s
important
to
check
the
entry
requirements,
as
these
vary
from
course
to course.
Course content
Does
the
course
contain
units
that
your
child
finds
motivating
and
enjoyable?
How
will
the
course
be
assessed?
Think
about
your
child’s
strengths
–
are
they
suited
to
coursework
or
exam
based
assessments?
Would
they
like
the
option
of
studying
abroad
or
doing
a
placement year?
Professional accreditation
Is
there
a
specific
profession
that
they
want
to
enter
that
requires
a
degree
with
a
professional
accreditation?
For
example,
our
psychology
degrees
are
accredited
by
the
British
Psychological
Society,
which
allows
graduates
to
take
the
first
step
to
becoming
a
Chartered Psychologist.
Location
Where
do
they
want
to
study?
Do
they
want
to
stay
at
home
or
move
away?
If
they
are
looking
to
move
away,
what
accommodation
options
are available?
Supporting
your
child's
application
The
university
application
process
is
done
exclusively
through UCAS.
Your
child’s
application
should
be
supported
by
their
school
or
college,
who
will
talk
them
through
each
stage
and
help
them
with
things
like
writing
a
personal statement.
You
can
help by
keeping
track
of
key
dates,
understanding
the UCAS
tariff
system and
what
grades
your
child
is
aiming
for,
and
making
sure
they
fully
research
the
universities
they
are
applying
to
by
ordering
a
prospectus
or
attending
an
open day.
For
more
information
on
how
the
application
process
works,
see
the UCAS
guide
on
how
to
apply.
Understanding
student
finance
Student
finance
helps
cover
the
costs
of
higher
education
but
can
be
daunting
to
understand
for
new
students
and
parents
or
guardians.
Understanding
how
much
your
child
will
pay
for
university,
how
they
apply
for
the
funding,
and
when
it
will
be
repaid
will
help
make
the
process easier.
Your
child
will
need
to
apply
for
student
finance
separately
and
ensure
they
complete
their
application
before
the
deadline
to
be
guaranteed
funding.
You
will
also
need
to
provide
details
of
your
household
income
to
support their application. 
Visit gov.uk/student-finance to
find
out
how
to
apply
for
student finance.
Tuition fees
This
is
the
amount
your
child
pays
per
year
for
their
course
at
university.
These
costs
are
covered
upfront
by
a
tuition
fee
loan,
which
is
a
non-means
tested
form
of
funding
available
to
all
new,
eligible
undergraduate
students
in
the
UK.
Tuition
fees
are
paid
directly
to
the
university
on
your
behalf,
so
you
don’t
need
to
worry
about
making
sure
they’re
paid
on time.
Wondering
how
tuition
fees
are
spent?
See
how
we invest
fees
to
enhance
learning
experience.
Maintenance loans
Students
can
apply
for
help
with
living
costs
through
the
form
of
a
maintenance
loan.
This
is
money
from
your
funding
provider
to
cover
things
like
accommodation,
food,
travel
and
other
essentials.
How
much
you
can
borrow
depends
on
your
household
income,
length
of
your
course
and
whether
or
not
you’ll
be
living
at home.
If
you
have
more
than
one
child
attending
university
at
the
same
time,
they
will
each
be
entitled
to
borrow
more
in
recognition
that
you’ll
be
supporting
multiple
students
at once.
Maintenance
loans
are
paid
in
three
instalments
each
year
-
one
at
the
beginning
of
each
term.
This
helps
students
budget
and
manage
their
money
throughout
the year.
To
find
out
how
much
your
child
can
borrow,
visit
our
funding
your
studies
page.
Repayments
Repayments
start
from
the
April
after
graduation,
and
only
when
your
child
earns
over £25,725
per
year.
If
their
earnings
fall
below
this, repayments
are suspended.
The
amount
you
repay
each
month
depends
on
your
income.
Repayments
are
9%
of
earnings
above
the £25,725 per
year
threshold. For
example,
someone earning
£27,000
per
year
will repay
around £10
per month.
A
different
rate
may
apply
to
people
who
work
outside
of
the
UK
after
graduating.
Find
out
more
about
repaying
student
loans
at gov.uk.
Bursaries,
scholarships
and support
Universities
also
provide
funding
to
some
students
in
the
form
of
bursaries,
scholarships,
or
other
support
systems.
Typically,
these
are
pots
of
funds
managed
by
the
university
and
don’t
need
to
be repaid.
Manchester
Met
offers
support
in
a
number
of
ways
to
ensure
fair
access
and
encourage
the
success
of
students
of
all backgrounds.
You
can
find
out
what
kind
of
bursaries,
scholarships,

we

on

buster

If
you
are
25
or
over
and
considering
a
return
to
education,
we
have
practical
advice
about
studying
for
an
undergraduate
degree.
Mature
Students
Most
UK
universities
will
consider
you
to
be
a
mature
student
if
you
are
25
or
older
on
the
first
day
of
your course.
Being
a
mature
student
can
affect
some
aspects
of
studying
for
a
degree,
including
student finance
Although
you
may
have
different
things
to
think
about,
the
process
is
the
same
for everyone.
1.
Find
your
course
Whatever
your
reason
for
wanting
to
return
to
education,
the
first
step
is
to
find
the
right
course
for you.
Knowing
why
you
want
to
study
for
a
degree
will
help
you
make
a
shortlist
of
courses.
For
example,
if
you
want
to
change
your
career
or
get
a
promotion,
find
out
which
courses
are
required
for
your
target job.
Some
courses
can
be
done
part-time
or
online,
which
can
help
if
you
have
family
and
other
commitments
you
need

2.
Check
the
entry
requirements
All
our
undergraduate
courses
have
entry
requirements
–
the
qualifications
you
need
to
apply.
These
are
often
particular
grades
at
GCSE
and
A-level
(or
equivalent).
For
some
courses,
you
also
need
to
have
passed
relevant subjects.
If
you’ve
been
out
of
education
for
some
time
or
don’t
have
the
necessary
qualifications,
you
may
have
to
do an
access
course to
secure
your
place
at university.
If
you
want
advice,
you
can
contact our
enquiries
team.
Our
international
team
will
help
with
questions
about qualifications
from
other countries.
3.

Shandon

Guthrie
Las

USA
PhD
Philosophy
Graduate,
full-time
‘There
are
few
academic
experiences
in
my
history
that
I
would
say
have
changed
my
life
for
the
better,
and
my
PhD
programme
in
philosophy
through
MMU
sits
as
the
highest
on
this
list.
From
my
matriculation
to
my
graduation,
MMU
exhibited
an
unparalleled
professionalism
in
guiding
me
through
the
various
steps
of
my
studies.
Their
close
attention
to
providing
every
resource
at
my
disposal
along
with
a
genuine
concern
for
how
I
was
being
treated
by
MMU
put
me
at
ease.
As
an
international
student,
it
made
me
feel
comfortable
knowing
that
they
care
greatly
for
their
students
in
this
way.
My
supervisor
exceeded
my
expectations
in
every
possible
way.
From
his
scholarly
guidance
to
the
rigor
of
his
feedback,
he
drove
me
to
produce
no
less
than
high
quality
work.
He
was
not
only
an
indispensable
educational
guide,
he
was
a
mentor
and
friend
who
encouraged
me
every
step
of
the
way.’

PhD
Apparel
Graduate,

‘I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
starting
my
PhD
remotely.
My
advisors
have
been
as
accessible
and
responsive
as
if
I
were
on
the
campus.
Our
regular
Skype
sessions
have
substituted
for
in
person
meetings,
and
nothing
has
suffered
through
that
substitution.
Their
advisement
has
been
just
as
complete
and
detailed
as
if
in
person.
It
is
quite
possible
that
this
process
has
encouraged
my
own
organization
and
record
keeping.
So
many
of
the
support
materials
are
also
online,
including
instruction,
workshops,
and
information,
that
I
don’t
believe
there
has
been
any
significant
difference
in
the
process
or
the
outcome
of
my
work.’

‘As
I
embarked
on
the
PhD
journey,
one
of
the
decisive
factors
in
choosing
the
right
programme
was
the
flexibility
it
would
offer
in
terms
of
on-site
attendance.
Working
full-time
and
having
to
support
a
family,
it
became
essential
that
I
could
conduct
my
research
at
distance
while
still
benefit
from
active
supervision.
Manchester
Metropolitan’s
PhD
programme
offered
this
possibility.
I
received
regular
and
thoughtful
feedback
from
my
supervisors
over
the
course
of
my
research.
While
at
distance,
the
attentive
support
I
received
was
critical
in
driving
my
research
to
an
end.
The
PhD
journey
has
been
instrumental
in
learning
how
to
conduct
quality
research
and
for
further
career
development.’
Frequently
Asked
Questions
Distance
Learning
-
What
can
I
expect?
Once
registered,
students
are
required
to
complete
online
induction,
which
outlines
the
research
journey,
the
role
and
responsibilities
of
the
student
and
the
supervisor,
and
the
pre-registration
and
registration
processes.
Students
will
have
regular
meetings
with
supervisors
who
will
guide
and
advise
on
the
research.
The
meetings
will
take
place
via
Skype
(or
an
equivalent
platform)
at
mutually
convenient
times.
Students
also
follow
a
supporting
programme
of
research
training
provided
via
online
workshops
that
can
be
accessed
at
any
time.
The
precise
programme
will
be
tailored
to
each
student’s
needs,
and
will
be
decided
by
discussion
between
each
student
and
his/her
supervisors.
Students
wishing
to
present
their
research
at
national
or
international
conferences
can
apply
for
university
assistance
towards
conference
attendance.
Once
students
have
completed
their
programme
of
study,
their
final
submission
is
examined
in
a
viva-voce
examination
(oral
defence).
This
normally
takes
place
in
Manchester,
however
some
students
are
eligible
to
apply
to
do
their
oral
examination
via
video
conference. 
Distance
learning
students
receive
the
same
level
of
dedicated
support
as
students
based
on
campus
and
are
connected
to
Manchester
throughout
their
studies
via:
Regular
meetings
with
supervisors
(conducted
through
Skype
or
equivalent)
Access

How
will
supervision
take
place?
Meetings
with
supervisors
are
a
vital
part
of
your
studies
and
will
be
held
on
a
regular
basis.
As
a
distance-learning
student,
your
meetings
will
take
place
via
Skype,
or
an
equivalent
platform.
You
will
need
to
make
sure
you
have
access
to
the
required
equipment
and
infrastructure
to
make
these
meetings
possible.
Will
I
receive
research
training?
Yes.
Full-time
research
students
follow
an
approved
supporting
programme
of
study
equivalent
to
two
weeks
of
study
per
year,
and
part-time
students
half
that.
These
activities
provide
personal
and
professional
skills
and
the
skills
necessary
to
attain
competence
in
research
methods
and
knowledge
related
to
the
subject
of
the
thesis.
View
our PGR
Training
and
Development
Brochure
2019/20
for
more
information
about
opportunities
available.
Will
I
need
to
come
to
Manchester?
You
may
need
to
travel
to
Manchester
for
your
viva
(final
oral
examination),
which
will
be
held
on
campus.
However,
in
some
cases,
you
can
apply
to
do
your
oral
examination
via
a
pre-approved
video
conferencing
platform.
Read
more
about
the
Oral
Examination
by
Video
Conferencing
Policy
October
2019,
including
eligibility
criteria.
Depending
on
your
circumstances,
you
may
also
be
required
to
attend
induction
in
the
first
12
months
of
starting
your
studies.
We
would
encourage
you
to
visit
Manchester
at
other
times
during
your
period
of
study,
to
meet
your
supervisory
team
face-to-face,
to
present
your
research
at
conferences
and
to
get
a
feel
for
the
university,
but
there
are
no
formal
requirements
for
you
to
do
this,
and
if
you
are
unable
to
do
so,
your
studies
will
not
be
affected.
Visits
to
Manchester,
including
that
required
for
the
viva,
will
be
at
your
own
expense,
or
that
of
your
sponsor
(if
you
have
one).
Please
note
that
travel
to
the
UK
for
study
purposes
may
require
a
Visa.
For
further
information,
see mmu.ac.uk/international/visas-and-immigration.
When
does
the
programme
begin?
We
accept
new
enrolments
for
most
programmes
in
January,
April,
July,
and
September
each
year
(please
confirm
with
Faculty
Research
Degree
contacts).
In
order
to
give
us
sufficient
time
to
process
your
application,
we
would
recommend
applying
at
least
three
months
in
advance
of
your
preferred
start
date.

ensure

go
to
those
who
will
get
the
most
from
the
experience
of
living
in
a
residential
community
of
students.

is
why
we
reserve
the
majority
of
places
for
first
year
students,
though
we
also
give
priority
to
disabled
students.
We
do
not
group
students
on
University
course
profile
(e.g.
students
studying
on
the
same
course)
or
prioritise
students
for
a
particular
hall
based
on
the
proximity
of
their
academic
building
or
the
course
they
are
studying.

I

I

Being

I

the

In

to
the

the

they
have
assisted

by
offering

They
have
also

that

There
is
an

The

I

Manchester
Metropolitan
University
because
I
was
deciding
to
major
in
Speech
and
Language
Therapy
and
Manchester
Met
has
good
facilities
for
the
course.
In
terms
of
academic
rigor,
the
University
also
had
good
establishment
and
therefore,
was
one
of
my
top
choices.
The
University
understands
that
as
an
international
student,
moving
to
a
city
that
is
not
home
can
be
difficult.
Lecturers
are
motivating
and
schedule
meetings
with
you
should
you
want
to
discuss
how
things
are
going
and
whether
there
are
any
concerns
that
you
might
have.
There
are
also
international
societies
set
up
which
make
a
huge
difference,
as
it
is
a
great
place
to
meet
people. 
Manchester
is
a
diverse
city
and
there
are
many
different
international
events
here
along
with
the
opportunity
to
meet
other
international
students.
The
opportunity
to
make
friends
from
different
cultures
is
great
as
there
are
many
events
set
up
by
the
University.
There
are
many
student
discounts
available!
The
food
comes
in
a
wide
array
of
multi-national
cuisines
and
there
is
Chinatown
if
you
miss
food
from
home.
I
would
say
to
come
with
an
open
mind;
not
to
be
afraid
that
it
might
be
difficult
to
make
friends
or
find
people
with
common
interests
as
there
really
are
many
students!
Bring
some
of
your
favourite
foods
from
home
and
join
societies
where
you
can
feel
at
home,
whether
it
is
a
society
of
your
home
country
or
things
that
remind
you
of
home.
Take
the
opportunity
to
learn
new
things
and
enjoy
the
different
culture
that
Manchester
has
to
offer.

Multimedia
Journalism
Manchester
Met
is
one
of
the
few
universities
I
found
that
offer
Multimedia
Journalism
course
across
the
UK.
Looking
at
the
university
ranking
and
coming
to
a
visit
day,
I
knew
that
whatever
my
nationality,
ethnicity
or
beliefs
are
I
will
always
be
welcomed
in
Manchester
Met.
 Manchester
is
a
multicultural
city,
which
for
someone
like
me
who
came
all
the
way
from
Egypt
is
fascinating;
I
can
always
find
a
place
that
makes
me
feel
like
home.
In
addition,
compared
to
other
cities
that
I
visited
in
the
UK,
Manchester
people
are
extremely
friendly
and
willing
to
help. 
The
University
offered
me
a
huge
support
when
I
was
applying
for
my
visa,
the
international
team
helped
me
to
fill
the
application
step
by
step
while
assuring
me
that
I
do
not
need
to
stress
out
and
just
focus
on
my
studies.
I
would
recommend
that
international
students
attend
the
international
student-welcoming
week
to
get
to
know
about
all
the
different
societies
and
events
taking
place.
As
an
international
student,
it
is
easy
to
feel
homesick
but
there
is
always
something
going
on
to
attend
and
get
involved
in
at
Manchester

In

I

I

If

my

meet
a
variety
of
different
people
and
learn
more
about
the
world
in
general.
Living
away
from
home,
in
a
different
and
new
environment,
has
given
me
the
opportunity
to
learn
more
about
myself
as
well
as
others
around
me.
I
have
learnt
to
become
more
independent
and
have
adapted
to
a
multicultural
environment,
which
is
an
opportunity
I
would
have
missed
if
I
studied
in
my
home
country.
My
tutors
are
enthusiastic
about
their
subject
areas
and
dedicated
to
ensuring
that
students
gain
as
much
as
possible
from
each
lecture.
They
are
interested
in
the
progress
and
development
of
all
students
and
have
an
approachable
attitude
towards
queries
and
general
academic
support.
During
my
time
at
Manchester
Met,
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
develop
my
personal
and
professional
skills,
as
well
as
interact
with
professionals
from
my
field
of
work.
This
has
aided
me
in
understanding
more
about
future
career
options.
I
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
course
at
Manchester
Metropolitan
University
and
appreciate
the
effort
and
enthusiasm
shown
by
my
tutors
throughout
my
time
here.
You
should
definitely
consider
Manchester
Met
as
a
strong
option
for
your
academic
journey.

During

Following

I
began
my

working
for
many
of
the

service
in

The

teaching
and

facilities
are
impressive

there
are
lecture

modern

and
group

Manchester

offers
a
range
of
services
to
support
my
studies
and
professional
development.
Each
tutor
has
a
different
timeslot
every
week
to
answer
individual
questions
about
the
course.
Staff
at
the
careers
guidance
service
are
also
very
helpful
and
provide

about

and

I
can
even
book

Manchester

arranges
several
career

where

to
the
University
to
give
presentations,
allowing
students
to
learn
more
about
each
company
and
ask

recruitment
processes.
I
really
enjoy
living
in
Manchester
and
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
most
popular
cities
in
the
UK.
The
city
has
an
interesting
industrial
history,
which
you
can
learn
more
about
at
the
many
museums
including
the
Museum
of
Manchester,
the
Imperial
War
Museum
and
the
Museum
of
Science
and
Industry.
There
is
also
a
fantastic
range
of
pubs
and
restaurants
and
I
enjoy
trying
amazing
food
around
Manchester
in
my
free
time.
At
Manchester
Metropolitan
University,
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
improve
my
English
and
make
friends
from
all
over
the

Studying
here
has
been
very
enjoyable
and
has
prepared
me
for
my

The
university
provides
all
the
resources
a
student
needs
to
become
successful
in
their
studies
–
24/7
library
with
diverse
study
areas
to
help
prepare
for
your
assignments
or
practise
in
presentation
skills.
The
lab
and
workshop
areas
are
equipped
up
to
the
industry
standards
with
technicians
present
to
help
students
in
using
the
equipment.
In
addition,
the
university
takes
part
in
the
Formula
Student
competition,
participating
in
which
helped
me
to
gain
the
necessary
technical
and
team
working
skills.
The
course
provided
me
with
the
necessary
technical
foundation
and
helped
me
to
understand
what
the
real
Engineering
is
even
before
I
started
searching
for
jobs.
I
enjoyed
the
course
particularly
because
of
the
large
amount
of
hands
on
experience
and
technical
assignments
ratio
to
the
theory
based
lectures.
This
is
very
useful
for
those
who
want
to
not
only
learn
new
things,
but
also
to
be
able
to
apply
the
gained
knowledge
in
practical
applications.
This
is
especially
important
for
engineering
students.
In
regards
to
my
student
experience,
the
placement
year
helped
me
to
better
understand
the
real
world
application
of
all
the
knowledge
I
gained
at
the
university.
It
also
improved
my
time
management
skills,
which
helped
me
to
deal
with
complicated
assignments
and
projects
in
my
final
year.

status.
Manchester
Metropolitan
University’s
tuition
fees
remain
the
same
for
each
year
of
study
of
an
undergraduate
or
postgraduate
degree
providing
students
complete
their
course
in
the
normal
timeframe.
This,
combined
with
Manchester’s
low
cost
of
living,
is
an
important
consideration
when
comparing
total
study
costs
with
other
universities.

for
postgraduate
research

including
PhD,
MPhil,

by
Research,
are
categorised

Status
Tuition
fees
for
Home

and
EU

are
set
at
different
levels
to
tuition
fees
for
international
students.
We
can
only
decide
a
student’s
tuition
fee
status
after
we
receive
a
completed
application
form.
We
will
then
automatically
inform
all
students
who
will
need
to
pay
international
tuition
fees.
To
decide
the
tuition
fee
status
of
each

Manchester

uses
the
UK
government
Department
for
Business,
Innovation
and
Skills
guidelines
in
accordance
with
the

We
are
always
happy
to

How
to
become
a
Collaborative
Partner
There
are
three
steps
you
need
to
follow
to
become
a
Manchester
Met
collaborative
partner,
which
includes
activity
such
as
franchising
and
dual
awards:
1.
Initial
assessment
of
the
opportunity
The
International
Partnerships
team
together
with
academic
and
professional
colleagues
across
the
university
assess
a
proposed
partnership
to
decide
whether
it
meets
the
institution’s
strategic
objectives
and
is
viable.
2.
Partner
approval
Preliminary
visit
and
initial
due
diligence
A
Manchester
Met
team
visits
your
campus
to
further
explore
the
potential
for
collaboration,
discuss
expectations
and
a
best-suited
partnership
model.
We
also
undertake
a
due
diligence
process
to
review
the
financial,
legal
and
management
aspects
of
a
proposed
partnership.
Business
Case
Relevant
faculty
staff
together
with
the
International
Partnerships
Team
develop
a
business
case
document,
which
presents
a
project
plan
that
includes
market
research,
student
numbers,
proposed
fees
and
academic
staffing, which
is
then
submitted
for
approval.
Due
Diligence
Academic
Collaboration review all
documents
and
carry
out
the
second
part
of
the
due
diligence
to
ensure
the
quality and
standards
of
a
proposed
partnership.
3.
Programme
Approval
PARM
Event
Manchester
Met
employees
and
external
examiners
will
typically
visit
your
campus
to
hold a Programme
Approval,
Review
and
Modification
event
(PARM).
They
formally
review
the
partnership
proposal
and
make
a
final
decision
about
its
approval.
Signing
of
the
Contract
Once
approved
by
a PARM
event,
the
International
Partnerships
team and
colleagues
will
work
with
you
to
draft
and
sign
the
collaborative
partnership
contract.
How
to
become
a
Progression/Articulation
Partner
To
establish
a
progression/articulation
partnership
with
Manchester
Met,
you
will
have
to
follow
these
steps:
1.
Partner
approval
Manchester
Met
assesses
the
proposed
arrangement
and
carries
out
due
diligence
on
your
institution.
2.
Mapping
Exercise
Our
Faculty/
International
Progressions
Manager
carries
out
a
mapping
exercise
to
ensure
quality
and
standards
are
met.
3.
Approval
and
Contract
Signing

is
approved,
the
International
Partnerships
team
and
colleagues
will
work
with
you
to
draft

the
collaborative
partnership
contract.

The
Knowledge
Transfer
Partnership
scheme
(KTP)
is
a
long-standing,
government-funded
initiative
that
allows
businesses
to
improve
their
competitiveness,
productivity
and
performance.
The
programme
involves
your
organisation
and
Manchester
Metropolitan
University
joining
forces
to
address
a
specific
challenge.
A
KTP
places
a
jointly
selected
high
quality
graduate,
supported
by
a
leading
academic
team
for
between
1
and
3
years.
The
graduate
will
work
with
you
on
a
specific
project
to
significantly
and
permanently
improve
your
business
performance.
Projects
focus
on
strategic
business
solutions
to
generate
new
products,
develop
markets,
improve
operating
processes
and
systems
or
increase
sustainability.
How
do
I
get
involved
in
a
KTP?

We're

Supporting

integrity
We
strive
to
uphold
the
highest
standards
in
all
aspects
of
our

Through
its
career
development
programmes,
this
university
has
helped
me
to
learn
that
leadership
goes
beyond
a
top
down
approach.
Leadership
needs
to
be
exercised
on
a
daily
basis
and
is
about
taking
decisions
that
support
colleagues.

MetroPolis
Research
Excellence

Our
impact
helps
to
define
who
we
are
and
what
we
are
good
at.
Our
research
has
led
to
the
creation
of
biomedical
devices
that
have
saved
thousands
of
lives.
It’s
helped
Government’s
to
reduce
carbon
emissions.
It
has
changed
the
way
that
every
young
person
is
educated.
It
has
protected
human
rights,
addressed
ageing,
dementia
and
loneliness,
and
helped
to
make
links
between
the
arts,
culture,
wellbeing
and
the
economy.
Underpinning
all
of
this
is
a
desire
to
make
a
difference,
a
willingness
to
help
our
researchers
to
reach
out
and
to
connect
with
the
wider
world.
Take
a
look
at
examples
of
the
impact
of
our
research
drawn
from
the
case
studies
we
submitted
to
the
Research
Excellence
Framework.
They
also
contain
links
to
resources
such
as
our
impact
toolkit
and
information
on
how
we
are
at
the
forefront
of
efforts
to
bring
about
a
change
in
the
way
that
the
public
is
engaged
in
research
activities.

The
Research
Excellence
Framework
(REF)
is
the
system
for
assessing
the
quality
of
research
in
the
UK.
Results
from
the
REF
inform
the
allocation
of
research
funding,
provide
benchmarking
information
for
rankings
and
provide
accountability
for
public
investment
in
research.
The
REF
measures
the
quality
of
outputs,
the
reach
and
significance
of
impact
and
the
sustainability
of
the
research
environment.

formed
to
amplify
the

relevant
research
that
takes
place
within
Manchester
Metropolitan
University
whilst

the

of

makers.

the
opportunity
MMU
provides
to
work
across
disciplines
and
discover
new
ways
of
looking
at

for

A
blueprint
for
educational
excellence
Acknowledging
the
changes
and
challenges
of
the
sector,
our
Education
Strategy
is
built
to
match
and
support
our
future
ambition.
Our
2017
Education
Strategy
tackles
the
many
contemporary
challenges
faced
in
our
sector,
from
radical
regulatory
changes
to
increased
competition
and
higher
student
expectations.
Based
on
the
four
priority
areas
of
high
quality
teaching,
more
integrated
student
experiences,
promoting
teaching
as
a
professional
practice
and
deeper
engagement
on
and
off
campus,
it
addresses
our
ambition
to
achieve
educational
excellence
through:
The
delivery
of
consistent
achievement,
diversity
and
core
curricular
standards
Outstanding
environments
for
innovative,
flexible
and
internationalised
learning
Student
progression
and
success
through
outstanding
personalised
support
Staff
who
are
lifelong
learners,
fully
engaged
in
their
own
professional
development
The
use
of
data
and
information
to
inform
key
decisions
and
actions
Close
collaboration
with
students,
researchers
and
partners
to
improve
performance

International
growth
through
academic
strength
Our
Internationalisation
Strategy
is
designed
to
recognise
the
importance
of
internationalisation
through
an
academically-driven
framework.
Our
2017
strategy
for
Internationalisation
is
built
to
leverage
our
academic
strengths,
build
quality
partnerships
and
attract
higher
numbers
of
students
from
all
over
the
world.
We
recognise
the
importance
of
internationalisation
to
the
future
of
the
industry,
so
have
developed
an
academically-driven
framework
that
plays
to
our
teaching
and
research
strengths,
while
tackling
some
of
the
challenges
we
face
in
the
current
market.
This
framework
includes:
Working
closely
with
faculties
and
their
staff
to
create
a
joined-up
approach
Acknowledging
the
role
of
globalisation
as
both
a
driver
and
indicator
of
success
Building
our
international
reputation,
influence
and
institutional
sustainability
Ensuring
success
is
measured
alongside
our
broader
strategic
goals
Recognising
international
success
in
fields
such
as
creative,
education,
science
and
business
Encouraging
internationalisation
student,
alumni
and
partner
engagement
Institutional
commitment
to
strategic engagement

the
Erasmus+
programme

The
faculty
is
home
to
several
areas
of
world-leading
and
internationally
excellent
research
and
we
pride
ourselves
on
our
innovation
in
teaching
and
learning,
with
opportunities
for
our
students
to
engage
with
the
City
and
the
communities
beyond
the
university
through
an
engaged
curriculum.
Our
students
are
at
the
heart
of
everything
we
do
and
their
views
inform
many
of
our
decisions
from
curriculum
innovation
to
building
design.
Harnessing
the
natural
spirit
of
curiosity
in
our
staff
and
students,
we
will
instil
ambition
and
confidence
in
our
students
as
members
of
this
creative
community
which
is
inclusive,
truly
interdisciplinary
and
which
offers
a
learning
experience
like
no
other.
